# TP-XML-JS

This was an exercise about manipulating :
* XML (data container)
* XSL (stylesheet)
* JavaScript (DOM manipulation and interactions)

We used an XSL stylesheet to convert the xml in a HTML output.
Besides, we used Javascript to implement interactions, modify the DOM, and request data from the XML.
